# Scoreboard-revision
Scoreboard-r is a rewrite of my original Scoreboard plugin
## What is this?
Scoreboard-r is a free and powerful way to make animated Scoreboards for the Spigot API. It leverages special
techniques to achieve a no-flicker board that looks smooth to your players. It is very lightweight and fast due to its asynchronous design.
